Dungeoneering Helper is a [Bolt](https://github.com/adamcake/Bolt) plugin that provides an overlay of required keys on the dungeoneering map. The ultimate goal is to have this plugin mimic how [Alt1's DGKey](https://runeapps.org/dgkey) works, however I make no promises on that actually happening, specifically the multiplayer aspect

# Add this plugin from URL

## How to use
Skip to step 7 if you already know how to install Bolt plugins using the URL above.
1) Open the RS3 settings in the Bolt launcher and ensure "Enable Bolt plugin loader" is enabled
2) Open the plugin menu under the "Play" button in the main Bolt menu
3) Under manage plugins, click the "Install plugin from updater URL" button (the icon is a down arrow with a bar at the bottom)
4) Enter the link from the "Add this plugin from URL" section above and click confirm
5) Open the game and log in
6) Back in the plugin menu in the launcher, select your character. In the dropdown menu select "Dungeoneering Helper" and click the start button
7) At this point you wont see anything in game yet, but the plugin should be visible in the plugin manager with an X beside it
8) Enter a dungeon and ensure the dungeoneering map is visible on your screen. If it's not there you can click where the world map button normally is on your minimap to open it
9) You should now see keys and gatestones appear on your map whenever they are rendered on your screen

## Notes
- Currently the overlay placed on the dungeoneering map only works with 100% interface scaling.
- The plugin hasn't been tested on Warped floors, as I don't have access to them at the moment. Contributions are appriciated, even just providing data using Adamcake's [bolt-devplugin](https://github.com/Adamcake/bolt-devplugin).
- Same as above, the second gatestone isn't working at the moment, as I don't have access to it.

## Disclaimer
While it is entirely within RuneScape's TOS, Jagex has not yet acknowledged the Bolt Launcher's plugin system. Use this plugin (and others) at your own risk.
